Important update (tagged!). Check blog for more info( http://info.usherbrooke.ca/Prospectus/projets/ngs-blog/our-ngs-blog )

- New format uBasicNGS/uBasicNGSChrom/uBasicNGSExperiment. This format offers no options beyond the basic inherited ones and should be seen as a baseline
- Deprecated uGenericNGS family. Only used as parent/inherited class now.
- Signal generation functions in uRegion family overloaded for any other version.
- Specified copy constructors and assignement operators for every chrom level. 
- Constructor cleanup. Synchronized constructors at the chrom structure level, now every Chrom level structures can take a vector of elements as a constructor ( ex: uTagsChrom myNewChrom(vectorofuTags) ) 
- Fixed a few bugs in the parser and relaxed the conditions for a valid GFF/GTF format (now permits "." when data is unknown, thought this is not GFF/GTF compliant )
- Fixed problems with getDistinct and upgraded the test suite that allowed the problem to slip through.
