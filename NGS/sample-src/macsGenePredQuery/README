This sample will read every entry from a GenePred file ( typically obtained from UCSC table browser ), add an extra feature to each entry representing a 1K promoter region ( either before or after the gene depending on Strand ). It will then overlap from a MACS peak file, and return in standard output:

A) The list of peaks overlapping at least one gene ( not feature )
B) Information on every gene/peak and what was overlapped and what ( if any ) features where overlapped

It will also write a file containing only the peaks that overlapped at least a gene.

Signature is:
MacsGenePredQuery <MACS bed file> <UCSC genePred reference> <File to Write Overlaps>

To run the program on the included sample, use this command:
./MacsGenePredQuery macsSample.bed hg18SmallGenePred.genePred test.out > log.out
