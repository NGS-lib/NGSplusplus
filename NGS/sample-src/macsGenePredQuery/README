This sample will read every entry from a GenePred file ( typically obtained from UCSC table browser ), add an extra feature to each entry representing a 1K promoter region ( either before or after the gene depending on Strand ). It will then overlap from a MACS ( or standard BED6 ) peak file, and return

A) The list of peaks overlapping at least one gene or gene feature
B) Information on every gene/peak and what was overlapped.


Signature is
geneOverlap <MACS bed file> <UCSC genePred reference> <File to Write Overlaps>
