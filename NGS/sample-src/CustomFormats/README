This sample will load a file containing certain values, with the order and delimitor specified in the program call. It will read these values and write them in Bed 6 format.

The values can be START_POS END_POS CHR SCORE STRAND SEQ_NAME JUNK

JUNK is ignored when reading the file. All other values must appear at most once.

The signature is

CustomFormats <single character delimiter. t = tab s = space> <value from the above list, in proper order>

Supposing you have moved the 'customLoaded.txt' to the same directory as the built sample, to run the program the line would be

CustomFormats customLoaded.txt , START_POS END_POS SCORE CHR
