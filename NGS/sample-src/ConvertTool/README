This sample will convert a file from a format to another format.

Please note that this is a very basic conversion tool created for pedagogical purpose. 

The conversion is not guaranteed to be lossless (for instance, converting a BED file to BED format can result in a different file since the parser will handle any valid BED file while the writer will output a BED4 when the output type is BED).

Usage:
    ConvertTool <fileName> <inputType> <outputName> <outputType>
    fileName: The name of the file to convert.
    inputType: The type of the input file (i.e.: BED, SAM, WIG, etc...).
    outputName: The name of the output file.
    outputType: The type of the output file.
