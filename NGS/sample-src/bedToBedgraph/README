This sample will take a valid BED file and output the equivalent bedgraph file with a valid bedgraph header.

Note that with minimal effort and use of the functions in the UCSCHeader namespace, it would be possible to add options to write UCSC specific browser outputs.

Usage:
bedToBedgraph <file.bed> > <file.bedgraph>

Sample execution:
./bedToBedgraph macs_sample.bed > resultFile.bedgraph
