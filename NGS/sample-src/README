Before building these code examples, make sure you have built the NGS++ library in its default folders.

Code samples can be build, running:

./buildTests.sh

To build only a specific test:

./buildTests <pathToCppFile>
./buildTests DTools/DTools.cpp

The compiled tools can be then found in the bin/ folder.

Note, these tools are NOT robust. Specifically it is recommended to use them with data samples in the same directory. 

To make command line programs that are robust to filepaths we recommend using Boost::filesystem and the TCLAP library. However, these functionalities are not included in NGS++ nor are they of the purview of the library.
