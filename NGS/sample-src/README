Before building these code examples, make sur you have built the NGS++ library in its default folders.

Code samples can be build, running:

./buildTests.sh

To build only a specific test:

./buildTests <pathToCppFile>
./buildTests DTools/DTools.cpp

The compiled tools can be then found in the bin/ folder.
