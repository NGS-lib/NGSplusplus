This sample will take any number of bed3 to bed6 files. It will do the combinatorial overlap of every file, and output the results of each overlap, with a given overlap containing only the portions of both files that overlapped.

So overlapping fileA, B and C will generate the following files

AoverlapB
AoverlapC
BoverlapC
AoverlapBoverlapC


The sample requires the data to be in the directory you are running from ( now system paths ). Sample execution is

recurseBedOverlap simpleA.bed simpleB.bed simpleC.bed simpleD.bed
