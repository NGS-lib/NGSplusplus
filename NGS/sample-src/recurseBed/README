This sample will take any number of bed3 to bed6 files. It will do the combinatorial overlap of every file, and output the results of each overlap, with a given overlap containing only the portions of both files that overlapped.

So overlapping file A, B and C will generate the following files:

AoverlapB
AoverlapC
BoverlapC
AoverlapBoverlapC

The sample signature is the following for file 1 to N:
recurseBedOverlap <file1> <file2> ... <fileN>

The sample requires the data to be in the directory you are running from ( now system paths ). Sample execution is
./recurseBedOverlap simpleA.bed simpleB.bed simpleC.bed simpleD.bed
