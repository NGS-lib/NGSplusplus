The main goals of NGS++ is one of data manipulation and interface transparency. We aim to make it as easy as possible to manipulate NGS datasets via an intuitive format parsing and writing interface and a transparent internal format that allows the user to easily define there own functions. We specifically do not offer an exhaustive toolbox of analysis tools, focusing instead on offering a robust, intuitive interface that allows to developer to easily define his own functions as needed.

Before building the library, it is necessary to have available a C++ compiler that supports the C++11 standard. While several options are available, we suggest using GCC 4.7.0 and the following section includes instructions on how to obtain it on certain distributions.
  
If you are running Ubuntu 12.04 or Linux Mint 13, the following will install gcc 4.7

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test 
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install gcc-4.7 g++-4.7

If you are running openSUSE 12.2, the following will install make and gcc 4.7
    sudo zypper update
    sudo zypper install make
    sudo zypper install gcc-c++

Note: For older version of openSUSE, the previous commands may install an older version of gcc. In this case, you can install the latest version with this command
    sudo install gcc47-c++

If you are on another linux system, it is quite likely you can find a repository with the binaries available with a minimal amount of search. Otherwise, instructions on how to build the latest gcc are available on the gcc website (http://gcc.gnu.org/install/build.html)

Important changes will be documented in the CHANGELOG file.

-----------------------
Install:
-----------------------

To compile library:
cd NGS
make

If your default g++ is not version 4.7 or higher, you can compile with an alternate compiler 
(in this example, it's named g++-4.7):
make GXX="g++-4.7"

To install library (this will copy the library to /usr/lib and add headers in /usr/include):
make install

To compile sample code:
cd sample-src 
./buildTests

If your c++11 standard complient compiler is not named g++, you can call the buildTests with another compiler. 
In the next example, the compiler is name g++-4.7:
./buildTests g++-4.7

-----------------------
Uninstall
-----------------------

If you wish to remove library and intermediate files (*.o) from git directory, in NGSplusplus/NGS/ type:
make clean

To uninstall library (this will remove the library from /usr/lib and remove headers from /usr/include), in NGSplusplus/NGS/ type:
make uninstall
