To compile library:
cd NGS
make

If your default g++ is not version 4.7 or higher, you can compile with an alternate compiler 
(in this example, it's named g++-4.7):
cd NGS
make GXX="g++-4.7"

To install library (this will copy the library to /usr/lib and add headers in /usr/include):
cd NGS
make install

To remove intermediate files (*.o) and library from current directory:
cd NGS
make clean

To compile sample code:
cd NGS
make samples

To uninstall library (this will remove the library from /usr/lib and remove headers from /usr/include):
cd NGS
make uninstall
